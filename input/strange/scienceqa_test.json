Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel. People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

During his observations, Jeremiah counted the number of visits by cardinals to feeders with sunflower seeds and the number of visits by cardinals to feeders with flax seeds.\nFigure: a cardinal visiting a platform feeder with sunflower seeds. Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?", "question_id": "324"}, {"image": "scienceqa/images/test/330/image.png", "question": "What is the capital of Massachusetts?", "answer": "(c) Boston", "choices": ["Cambridge", "Plymouth", "Boston", "Dover"], "context": " ", "question_id": "330"}, {"image": "scienceqa/images/test/332/image.png", "question": "Which animal is also adapted to be camouflaged in the snow?", "answer": "(a) short-tailed weasel", "choices": ["short-tailed weasel", "common hawk-cuckoo"], "context": "Arctic wolves live in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland.

The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Edwin thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water. People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two Syrian hamsters. Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff.

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed.

Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.\nFor example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12\nIf their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\n", "question_id": "4833"}, {"image": "scienceqa/images/test/4834/image.png", "question": "Which animal is also adapted to use its neck to appear large and scary to a predator?", "answer": "(a) bearded dragon", "choices": ["bearded dragon", "green anole"], "context": "Spectacled cobras are snakes.

But she didn't know how often the prairie should be burned.\nDr. Spencer marked off six plots within a large area of the prairie. She used carefully controlled fires to burn all of the plants in each plot. She burned three of the plots once a year for three years. She burned the other three plots twice a year for three years. A year after the last fire, Dr. Spencer counted the number of unwanted grasses in each of the six plots.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure.\nFigure: a fire burning through a prairie. Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.\nThe amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nErnest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel. People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.\nIf different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract.

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nMuscle movement is controlled by charged atoms called ions. Ions move in and out of muscle cells through tube-like structures called channels.\nOne of these channels is made from the chloride channel protein. The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene.\nA certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure.\nThis different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease.\nFigure: muscles in the human body. An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.\nA permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.\nThe function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.\nAn organism's observable traits are affected by the functions of its proteins.

Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!

Kathleen was a bioengineer who wanted to increase the amount of insulin that the bacteria produced by 20%. She read that giving the bacteria more nutrients could affect the amount of insulin they produced. So, Kathleen gave extra nutrients to some of the bacteria. Then, she measured how much insulin those bacteria produced compared to bacteria that did not get extra nutrients.\nFigure: studying bacteria in a laboratory. People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds.", "question_id": "9344"}, {"image": "scienceqa/images/test/9345/image.png", "question": "Which country is highlighted?", "answer": "(d) Dominica", "choices": ["Haiti", "Saint Kitts and Nevis", "the Dominican Republic", "Dominica"], "context": " ", "question_id": "9345"}, {"image": "scienceqa/images/test/9357/image.png", "question": "Which property do these four objects have in common?", "answer": "(a) salty", "choices": ["salty", "fuzzy", "smooth"], "context": "Select the best answer.

If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Mason put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

To make the concrete, they mixed together dry cement powder, gravel, and water. Then, they checked if each batch was firm enough using a test called a slump test.\nThey poured some of the fresh concrete into an upside-down metal cone. They left the concrete in the metal cone for 30 seconds. Then, they lifted the cone to see if the concrete stayed in a cone shape or if it collapsed. If the concrete in a batch collapsed, they would know the batch should not be used.\nFigure: preparing a concrete slump test. People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

The allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies. Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.\nIn a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies. Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff.

In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles. The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two cockatiels. Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff.

How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed.

So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured.

Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.\nFor example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents.

The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two cows. Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured.

Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.\nIn a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants. Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

Experiments can be designed to answer specific questions. How can you identify the questions that a certain experiment can answer? In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured.

Audrey's coworker recommended spraying the air plants with a mist of water every day.\nAudrey decided to test both ideas. First, she measured the initial weight of all four air plants. Then, for the next two months, she sprayed two of the plants with a mist of water each day. She watered the two remaining plants by soaking them in water once a week. Finally, Audrey measured the weight of the plants again and calculated the change in weight for each plant.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure.\nFigure: an air plant displayed on a rock. Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to find out how one variable affects another variable. For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.\nThe amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.\nThe number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring.

Offspring genotypes: homozygous or heterozygous?\nHow do you determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for a gene? Look at the alleles in the organism's genotype for that gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene.\nIf both alleles are dominant, the organism is homozygous dominant for the gene.\nIf both alleles are recessive, the organism is homozygous recessive for the gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. \nBecause there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring.

In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for white flowers (f) is recessive to the allele for red flowers (F).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two scarlet rosemallow plants. Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff.

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel. People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

The table below shows some traits used to describe each kingdom.\n | Bacteria | Archaea | Protists | Fungi | Animals | Plants\nHow many cells do they have? | one | one | one or many | one or many | many | many\nDo their cells have a nucleus? | no | no | yes | yes | yes | yes\nCan their cells make food? | some species can | some species can | some species can | no | no | yes", "question_id": "15623"}, {"image": "scienceqa/images/test/15627/image.png", "question": "Which property matches this object?", "answer": "(b) stretchy", "choices": ["blue", "stretchy"], "context": "Select the better answer.

Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.

In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for black fur (F) is dominant over the allele for brown fur (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two Labrador retrievers. Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff.

The Thingvellir Rift Valley is one example. This rift valley began to form as the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate moved away from each other. In this picture, you can see the gap that formed during a major plate movement along the rift. Gaps such as this form when the two plates move apart, creating a large crack in the crust. The last time this happened in the Thingvellir Rift Valley was in the spring of 1789. Since then, a walking path was built along the rift valley to allow park visitors to walk along the rift. The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:\nAt a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.\nAt a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.\nAt a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.\ndivergent plate boundary\nWhen plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.\nNewer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain.

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nDuncan was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Duncan put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel. People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.\nFlowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.\nBoth the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.\nPollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.\nAfter pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.\nThe new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again.", "question_id": "16932"}, {"image": "scienceqa/images/test/16935/image.png", "question": "Which property matches this object?", "answer": "(b) colorful", "choices": ["translucent", "colorful"], "context": "Select the better answer.

Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.\nIn a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants. Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen.

The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Kenny thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music.

People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design. How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location.

Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested.

In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured.

Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.\nIn a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings.

The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies. Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff.

Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.\nThe function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.\nAn organism's observable traits are affected by the functions of its proteins. So, a gene mutation that affects a protein's function may also affect an organism's observable traits.", "question_id": "21053"}, {"image": "scienceqa/images/test/21063/image.png", "question": "Which country is highlighted?", "answer": "(d) Dominica", "choices": ["the Dominican Republic", "Saint Lucia", "Grenada", "Dominica"], "context": " ", "question_id": "21063"}, {"image": "scienceqa/images/test/21064/image.png", "question": "What is the capital of Nevada?", "answer": "(a) Carson City", "choices": ["Carson City", "Reno", "Las Vegas", "Cheyenne"], "context": " ", "question_id": "21064"}, {"image": "scienceqa/images/test/21070/image.png", "question": "Which continent is highlighted?", "answer": "(b) Africa", "choices": ["Europe", "Africa", "Asia", "North America"], "context": " A continent is one of the major land masses on the earth.

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.\nThe strength of a force is called its magnitude.
